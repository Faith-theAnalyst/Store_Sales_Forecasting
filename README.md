Welcome to the **Corporation Favorita Store Sales Analysis** repository. This analysis is aimed at providing insights into the sales patterns of the Corporation Favorita grocery chain and creating effective predictive models for sales forecasting.

## Overview

Corporation Favorita, a well-renowned grocery chain, experiences challenges in maintaining the right stock levels across its various retail locations. Through this analysis, we aim to provide a data-driven approach to mitigate these challenges and help in optimizing inventory management.

## Data Description

Our dataset comprises detailed sales data from Corporation Favorita stores and other associated datasets. A brief description of the datasets is as follows:

- **Sales Data**: This dataset contains the sales figures recorded for different product families across multiple stores. It includes columns such as `date`, `store_nbr`, `family`, `sales`, and `onpromotion`.
  
- **Stores Data**: This dataset provides information about individual stores. The data fields include `store_nbr`, `city`, `state`, `type`, and `cluster`.
  
- **Oil Prices Data**: Represents the daily oil prices with the columns `date` and `dcoilwtico`.

- **Holidays and Events Data**: Lists out different holidays and events with their type, locale, description, and whether they are transferred.

- **Transactions Data**: Details the number of transactions done on particular dates across various stores.

## Analysis Approach: CRISP-DM Methodology

We adopt the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology for this analysis. It involves six key phases:

1. **Business Understanding**: Initial phase where we define objectives and formulate hypotheses.
2. **Data Understanding**: Deep dive into the data to understand its structure, quality, and nuances.
3. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, transforming, and enriching the data for analysis.
4. **Modeling**: Building predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the models against actual data to gauge accuracy and reliability.
6. **Deployment**: Implementing the best models into real-world systems.
